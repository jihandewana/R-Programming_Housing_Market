### Detail Study Case 👉 [Housing Market Data Analysis in R Project](https://learn.365datascience.com/projects/preview/housing-market-data-analysis-in-r-project/)

This project explores the real-world factors that drive property values, looking at everything from neighborhood safety to the actual space inside a home. 
By using data tools, raw housing information is transformed into clear, visual stories that help realtors and buyers make sense of the market. 
Beyond just looking at the past, the analysis includes a predictive model to estimate house prices based on the most influential factors found in the data. 
Ultimately, this work provides a practical way for anyone in the housing market to make decisions with more confidence and better insight.

### The Key Findings
- **The Biggest Price Driver**: While many things matter, the number of rooms is the most powerful factor in determining a house's price. There is a very strong connection between living space and market value.
- **Predicting Value**: The analysis created a model that successfully explains about 76% of why house prices fluctuate. The other 24% comes from unique factors not captured in this specific data.
- **A Snapshot of the Market**: Looking at 506 homes, the average property is valued at 47.10 (in thousands) and typically features about 6 rooms.
- **Safety and Community**: The study split neighborhoods almost evenly by safety, finding that 51.2% of the homes were in areas with slightly higher crime rates, while 48.8% were in lower-crime areas.
- **Focusing on What Matters**: Surprisingly, while things like public transport and local schools are important for daily life, the data showed they didn't have a statistically significant impact on the final price compared to the number of rooms.
